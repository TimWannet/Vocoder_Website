## Update #1

The vocoder project is officially underway, and I’m excited to share the first update with you!
This is the start of an open-source journey where I’ll be designing, building, and fine-tuning a fully-featured vocoder.

In this first video, I introduce the project and what a vocoder is, break down my initial design goals, and go over the hardware I’ll be working with.
Also at the end I give a small demo to showcase what the software can do so far.

Enjoy the full video here:

I’ll be posting regular updates (every two weeks) as I refine the design, troubleshoot challenges, and bring this vocoder to life.

If you’re as excited about this as I am, stay tuned for more blog posts and videos—and don’t forget to sign up if you want to be among the first to get a kit or build your own!

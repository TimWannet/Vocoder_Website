## Update #2

Here's the second update from this saga!
I am excited to share the latest progress, which includes an introduction to this website and a sneak peek into the sound direction of the vocoder.

My approach for this video was to make it less technical while still showing everything I have been working on.
I learned a lot from making the last video, and I wanted to make this one more compact and engaging for a broader audience.
I hope to show you more tangible results in the next updates and to minimise conceptual explanations.
Thank you so much for your interest.

Enjoy the full video here:

I’m thrilled to share more updates in the future.
